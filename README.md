## WARNING: DOCUMENTATION
We haven't generated any documentation yet. That is because we can't find any documentation generators. We will try to do this for sprint 2. For now- to prove that we can document our code, we've in our readme and example of one documentated class.

But please know that all of our classes are commented and thus serves as 'documented code'?
